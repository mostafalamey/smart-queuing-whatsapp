# Animated Push Notification Popup Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds beautiful animated in-app notification popups to the customer app that appear when push notifications are received or when specific events occur in the queue system.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¬ Animation Types

- **Slide Down**: Gentle entrance animation for ticket creation notifications
- **Bounce In**: Attention-grabbing bounce effect for "almost your turn" alerts
- **Pulse Glow**: Urgent pulsing animation with green glow for "your turn" notifications
- **Fade In**: Simple fade animation for general notifications

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design

- **Color-coded borders**: Blue (ticket created), Orange (almost your turn), Green (your turn)
- **Contextual icons**: Bell, Clock, and Check Circle icons based on notification type
- **Auto-dismiss**: 5-second countdown with animated progress bar
- **Manual close**: X button for immediate dismissal

### ðŸ“± Responsive Features

- **Mobile-optimized**: Designed for mobile-first experience
- **Top-right positioning**: Non-intrusive placement
- **Smooth animations**: Hardware-accelerated CSS animations
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### 1. `PushNotificationPopup.tsx`

- New component for displaying animated notifications
- Custom CSS animations for different notification types
- Self-contained SVG icons (no external dependencies)
- Auto-dismiss functionality with progress indicator

#### 2. `page.tsx` (Customer App Main Page)

- Integrated notification state management
- Service worker message listener for real push notifications
- Polling system for ticket status changes
- In-app notification triggers for key events

#### 3. `sw.js` (Service Worker)

- Enhanced to send messages to the app when push notifications arrive
- Dual notification system: system notifications + in-app popups

### Notification Triggers

#### Real-time Notifications

1. **Ticket Creation**: Shows immediately when a ticket is successfully created
2. **Queue Position Updates**: Displays when customer moves up in queue (positions 1-3)
3. **Service Ready**: Alerts when it's the customer's turn to be served

#### Push Notification Integration

- Listens for messages from service worker when push notifications are received
- Automatically determines animation type based on notification data
- Seamlessly works alongside existing push notification system

### Animation System

#### CSS Keyframes

```css
@keyframes slide-down { /* Gentle slide from top */ }
@keyframes bounce-in { /* Elastic bounce entrance */ }
@keyframes pulse-glow { /* Pulsing with glow effect */ }
@keyframes fade-in { /* Simple opacity transition */ }
@keyframes progress { /* Progress bar countdown */ }
```

#### Animation Mapping

- `ticket_created` â†’ `slide-down` (Blue theme)
- `almost_your_turn` â†’ `bounce-in` (Orange theme)  
- `your_turn` â†’ `pulse-glow` (Green theme)
- `general` â†’ `fade-in` (Gray theme)

## Usage

### Automatic Triggers

The notifications automatically appear when:

- A customer successfully joins the queue
- Their position in queue changes (top 3 positions)
- It's their turn to be served
- Push notifications are received from the admin panel

### Manual Testing

During development, test buttons were available to preview all animation types. These have been removed in the production version.

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

```typescript
const [currentNotification, setCurrentNotification] = useState<{
  title: string
  body: string
  type: 'ticket_created' | 'almost_your_turn' | 'your_turn' | 'general'
  timestamp: number
} | null>(null)
```

### Service Worker Communication

```javascript
// Service worker sends message to app
client.postMessage({
  type: 'PUSH_NOTIFICATION',
  payload: { title, body, data }
})

// App listens for messages
navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  if (event.data?.type === 'PUSH_NOTIFICATION') {
    setCurrentNotification(/* ... */)
  }
})
```

### Polling System

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (ticketNumber && pushNotificationsEnabled) {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      checkTicketStatusForNotifications()
    }, 30000) // Check every 30 seconds
    
    return () => clearInterval(interval)
  }
}, [ticketNumber, pushNotificationsEnabled])
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Lightweight**: Minimal bundle size impact with custom SVG icons
- **Efficient**: Uses CSS animations instead of JavaScript
- **Battery-friendly**: Polling only when necessary (ticket exists)
- **Memory-safe**: Proper cleanup of intervals and event listeners

## Browser Compatibility

- **Modern browsers**: Full support with hardware acceleration
- **Mobile devices**: Optimized for touch interfaces
- **PWA mode**: Works seamlessly in Progressive Web App mode
- **Service workers**: Gracefully degrades if service workers unavailable

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

- Sound notifications (with user permission)
- Vibration feedback on mobile devices
- Custom animation preferences
- Batch notification handling
- Integration with device notification settings

This implementation provides a delightful user experience that keeps customers informed about their queue status with beautiful, contextual animations while maintaining high performance and accessibility standards.
