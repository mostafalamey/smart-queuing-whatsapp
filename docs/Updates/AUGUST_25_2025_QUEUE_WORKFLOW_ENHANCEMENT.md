# Queue Management Workflow Enhancement - August 25, 2025

## 🎯 Session Overview

This session focused on enhancing the queue management workflow to ensure proper customer handling and improve the user experience with better visual design and standardized notifications.

## 🚀 Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Mandatory Skip/Complete Workflow Control

#### Problem Solved

Staff could call the next customer without properly handling the current one, leading to confusion and potential service gaps.

#### Solution Implemented

- **Workflow Enforcement**: Users must now click "Skip" or "Complete" before calling the next customer
- **Button State Management**: "Call Next Customer" button is disabled when a ticket is currently being served
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear messaging when action is required
- **State Persistence**: System tracks ticket handling status across real-time updates

#### Technical Implementation

- Added `currentTicketHandled` state to `useDashboardData` hook
- Implemented `markCurrentTicketAsHandled()` function
- Modified button disable logic in `QueueStatus` component
- Added helpful messages and visual cues

### 2. Enhanced Currently Serving Card Design

#### Visual Improvements Made

- **Prominent Action Buttons**: Increased button size, better colors, and improved spacing
- **Layout Reorganization**: Moved buttons to their own row with grid layout
- **Dynamic Styling**: Card appearance changes when action is required
- **Professional Animations**: Enhanced hover effects and visual feedback
- **Compact Design**: Optimized spacing to prevent vertical scrolling

#### Design Changes

- **Button Layout**: Changed from horizontal cramped layout to full-width grid (2 columns)
- **Button Sizing**: Increased padding from `py-1.5` to `py-3` and `px-3` to `px-4`
- **Color Enhancement**: Added gradient backgrounds and better contrast
- **Visual States**: Amber/orange theme for active tickets, animated indicators
- **Typography**: Improved text hierarchy and readability

### 3. Standardized Toast Notification System

#### Notification Consistency

- **Unified Confirmations**: Both Skip and Complete now use time-based countdown toasts
- **Consistent Success Messages**: Standardized format for all queue operation results
- **Progress Bar Indicators**: Visual countdown timers for all confirmations
- **Professional Language**: Customer-focused messaging throughout

#### Toast Implementation Details

- **Confirmation Flow**: Both actions use `showInfo()` for initial confirmation
- **Success Flow**: Both actions use `showSuccess()` for completion confirmation
- **Timing**: 5-second countdown timers with progress bars
- **Action Buttons**: "Call Next Customer" action available on success toasts
- **Auto-Dismiss**: Consistent behavior across all notification types

## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Components

1. **`useDashboardData.ts`** - Added state management for ticket handling
2. **`QueueStatus.tsx`** - Enhanced button disable logic and messaging
3. **`QueueManager.tsx`** - Redesigned currently serving card layout
4. **`useQueueOperations.ts`** - Standardized success notifications
5. **`page.tsx`** - Updated function calls and state management

### Key Changes Made

#### State Management (`useDashboardData.ts`)

```typescript
const [currentTicketHandled, setCurrentTicketHandled] = useState(false);

const markCurrentTicketAsHandled = useCallback(() => {
  setCurrentTicketHandled(true);
}, []);

// Auto-reset when new ticket starts being served
if (newCurrentServing !== previousCurrentServing) {
  setCurrentTicketHandled(false);
}
```

#### Button Logic (`QueueStatus.tsx`)

```typescript
disabled={
  !queueData.waitingCount ||
  loading ||
  (!!queueData.currentServing && !currentTicketHandled)
}
```

#### Toast Standardization (`useQueueOperations.ts`)

```typescript
showSuccess(
  "Customer Skipped Successfully!",
  `Ticket ${servingTicket.ticket_number} has been skipped and marked as cancelled.`,
  {
    label: "Call Next Customer",
    onClick: () => {
      /* Call next function */
    },
  }
);
```

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### Before This Session

- ❌ Staff could skip proper customer handling workflow
- ❌ Cramped, hard-to-use action buttons
- ❌ Inconsistent notification types (warning vs info vs success)
- ❌ No clear indication when action was required
- ❌ Vertical scrolling issues on smaller screens

### After This Session

- ✅ **Enforced Workflow**: Must handle current customer before calling next
- ✅ **Prominent Controls**: Large, accessible Skip/Complete buttons
- ✅ **Consistent Notifications**: Standardized countdown timer confirmations
- ✅ **Clear Visual Feedback**: Dynamic card states and helpful messages
- ✅ **Optimized Layout**: Compact design preventing page scroll issues

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### State Flow

1. **Customer Called** → `currentTicketHandled = false`
2. **Currently Serving Card** becomes visually prominent
3. **Call Next Button** becomes disabled with helpful message
4. **Skip/Complete Clicked** → Shows countdown confirmation toast
5. **Action Confirmed** → Executes operation + `markCurrentTicketAsHandled()`
6. **Success Toast** → Shows completion message with countdown
7. **Call Next Button** → Re-enabled for next customer

### Component Hierarchy

```workflow
Dashboard Page
├── QueueManager (Currently Serving Card)
│   ├── Skip Button → showInfo() → onSkipTicket()
│   └── Complete Button → showInfo() → onCompleteTicket()
└── QueueStatus (Call Next Button)
    ├── Disabled when currentTicketHandled = false
    └── Helper message when action required
```
