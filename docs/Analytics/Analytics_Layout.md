üî• This layout gives you **exec-level KPIs up top, operational detail in the middle, forecasting at the bottom.**
It‚Äôs modular: you can roll out _KPIs + Queue Performance first_, then layer in _Employee/Productivity_, then _Forecasting_ later.

---

Do you want me to now **map these widgets to Supabase queries** (e.g., SQL for avg wait time, tickets per dept, no-show rate), so you can wire it directly into the frontend?
