  - `.page-header` system with variants (`.full-width`, `.no-bottom-margin`)
  - `.analytics-card` family (`.analytics-card-kpi`, `.analytics-card-stats`)
  - Pattern analysis styles (`.pattern-bar-volume`, `.pattern-bar-waittime`)
  - Color classes for data visualization intensity levels

### Component Updates

- **Analytics Header**: Consistent styling with other page headers
- **KPI Section**: Unified card styling with proper spacing
- **Queue Performance**: Vertical layout, responsive charts with viewBox
- **Volume Section**: Consistent card styling, improved spacing
- **Historical Trends**: Enhanced Analytics card styling
- **Predictive Insights**: Enhanced Analytics card styling
- **Peak Patterns**: Complete rebuild with safety checks and inline style optimization

### Layout Improvements

- **Responsive Design**: Charts now properly constrain and scale
- **Vertical Stacking**: Queue Performance and Volume sections stack vertically for better mobile UX
- **Consistent Spacing**: `space-y-6` used throughout for uniform vertical rhythm
- **Card Consistency**: All analytics cards use the same background, border, and shadow system

## 🎨 **Visual Design Enhancements**

### Before Phase 2 Issues ❌

- Inconsistent header styling across pages
- Mixed card designs with different shadows, borders, padding
- Side-by-side layouts causing chart overflow on mobile
- Scattered inline styling making maintenance difficult
- Chart responsiveness issues
- NaN values displayed to users

### After Phase 2 Improvements ✅

- **Unified Headers**: All pages use consistent `.page-header` styling with rounded corners and shadows
- **Card Consistency**: Professional card system with unified backgrounds, borders, and hover effects
- **Mobile Optimized**: Vertical layouts prevent overflow and improve readability
- **Maintainable Styles**: Static styling centralized in globals.css, inline styles only for dynamic data
- **Responsive Charts**: SVG charts with viewBox scale properly on all devices
- **Safe Data Display**: NaN handling with fallbacks to 0, proper number formatting

---

## 💻 **Code Quality Improvements**

### Maintainability

- **Centralized Styling**: Static styles moved from components to globals.css
- **Consistent Classes**: Standard class names across all analytics components
- **Reduced Duplication**: Shared styling patterns eliminate code repetition
- **Better Organization**: Clear separation between styling and business logic

### Performance

- **CSS Classes**: Faster rendering than scattered inline styles
- **Optimized Layouts**: Efficient flexbox and grid layouts
- **Responsive Images**: Proper chart scaling without layout thrashing
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Consolidated CSS instead of component-specific styles

### Developer Experience

- **Predictable Styling**: Consistent class system makes development faster
- **Easy Maintenance**: Changes to styling system apply globally
- **Clear Patterns**: Established patterns for new analytics components
- **Documentation**: Well-documented CSS classes in globals.css
